\section*{Abstract}

\section*{Introduction}
With the displacement of spatial points in $x_1$- and $x_2$-direction represented as
\begin{equation*}
\boldsymbol{u} = \begin{bmatrix}
u_1 \\ u_2
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
the strain on each point is
\begin{equation*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{11} \\
\epsilon_{22} \\
\epsilon_{12}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_1} \\
\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_2} \\
\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial x_2}+\frac{\partial u_2}{\partial x_1}
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
as many notes on linear elasticity will let you know.\footnote{Note however that this is the form usually called engineer strain.} 

The connection between the strain $\epsilon$ and the stress $\sigma$ is
\begin{align*}
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} \\ \sigma_{22} \\ \sigma_{12}
\end{bmatrix}
&= \frac{E}{1-\nu^2}\begin{bmatrix}
1 & \nu & 0 \\
\nu & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \frac{1-\nu}{2}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{11} \\ \epsilon_{22} \\ \epsilon_{12}
\end{bmatrix} \\
\boldsymbol{\sigma} &= C\boldsymbol{\epsilon}
\end{align*}
where $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio. Young's modulus characterises the solid's stiffness, i.e. large $E$ means that you need a large force to deform the solid. Poisson's ratio  is the ratio between the strains in $x_1$- and $x_2$-direction when submitting the solid to a stress in only one of the directions. To clarify: Consider a stress in only the $x_1$-direction direction\footnote{$\sigma_{11}$ being the only stress different from zero.}, then $\nu>0$ will say that the solid contracts in the $x_2$-direction and elongates in the $x_1$-direction. Worth noting is that $\nu<0$ is possible, and some materials actually have this property. Weird.
During the course of this analysis we will let $E$ and $\nu$ completely describe a solid's properties. No stress or strain due to difference in temperature.

\subsection*{The equation, or how we ended up with an element method}
In continuum mechanics
\begin{equation}
\label{vibDiff}
\rho \ddot{\boldsymbol{u}} = \nabla \sigma(\boldsymbol{u})
\end{equation}
describes the spatial displacement due to internal stresses alone. It is the extension of Hook's law and Newton's second law into a continuous medium. So rather than total mass we look at mass density, here denoted $\rho$.

To eventually arrive at variational formulation of \ref{vibDiff} we should spend some time with the right hand side of this equation to better understand it. For that reason we will take a slight detour and start our journey by considering the equation
\begin{align}
\label{linEl}
\nabla \sigma(\boldsymbol{u}) &= - \boldsymbol{f} \\
\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x_1},  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_2}\right]\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_{11} & \sigma_{12} \\
\sigma_{12} & \sigma_{22}
\end{bmatrix} &= -[f_1,f_2] \notag
\end{align}
working on some domain $\Omega$,
together with some boundary conditions, which in its general form looks a little something like
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{u} &= \boldsymbol{g}, \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega_D \\
\sigma(\boldsymbol{u})\cdot \boldsymbol{\hat{n}} &= \boldsymbol{h}, \quad \text{on } \partial \Omega_N
\end{align*}

As is usual procedure when trying to derive a variational formulation, we multiply \ref{linEl} with some test function $\boldsymbol{v}\in V$, where the function space $V$ will be determined from what seems useful during the derivation. Then we integrate over the domain to get
\begin{equation}
\label{step1}
\int_{\Omega} (\nabla \sigma(\boldsymbol{u}))\cdot \boldsymbol{v}d\Omega = \int_{\Omega}\boldsymbol{f}\cdot \boldsymbol{v} d\Omega .
\end{equation}
We aim at applying Green's formula to the left hand side, and since Green's formula states that
\begin{equation*}
\int_{\Omega}\nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{a}d\Omega = \int_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{a}\cdot \boldsymbol{\hat{n}}dS 
\end{equation*}
we should come up with a good candidate for $\boldsymbol{a}$. A good guess seems to be $\boldsymbol{a} = \sigma(\boldsymbol{u})\boldsymbol{v}$.
